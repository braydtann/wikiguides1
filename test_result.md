# WikiGuides OCP - Test Results and Development Progress

## Original User Problem Statement
Build a Wiki + Guided Flow Editor application with Omni Channel Platform (OCP) root architecture that includes:

1. **OCP Root Layer (Shared Across All Apps)**:
   - Authentication & Authorization
   - Roles & Access Control (Admin, Manager, Agent, Contributor, Viewer)
   - Departments & Teams
   - App Access Control (Admin Controlled)
   - UI/UX Consistency Framework

2. **App-Specific Features**:
   - Dual Portal Access (customer-facing and employee-facing)
   - Wiki System with hierarchy (Category â†’ Subcategory â†’ Article)
   - Guided Flow Creator & Editor (drag-and-drop visual flow builder)
   - Flow Execution Engine
   - Flow Summary & CRM Note Generator
   - Admin & User Management

## Development Progress

### âœ… Phase 1: OCP Foundation & Backend (COMPLETED)

**Backend Architecture:**
- FastAPI with Python 3.11
- MongoDB database integration
- JWT-based authentication
- Role-based access control (RBAC)
- Environment variables configuration

**APIs Implemented:**
- `/api/health` - Health check endpoint
- `/api/auth/register` - User registration with role assignment
- `/api/auth/login` - User authentication with JWT tokens
- `/api/auth/me` - Get current user information
- `/api/departments` - Department management (POST/GET)
- `/api/users` - User management with role updates

**Security Features:**
- Password hashing with bcrypt
- JWT token authentication
- Role-based permissions (Admin, Manager, Agent, Contributor, Viewer)
- Protected endpoints with authorization middleware
- Email validation and duplicate user prevention

### âœ… Frontend Foundation (COMPLETED)

**React Application:**
- React 18 with functional components
- Context API for authentication state management
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- React Router for navigation
- React Hot Toast for notifications

**Components Implemented:**
- Authentication Context (`AuthContext.js`)
- Login/Register Forms with validation
- Navigation with role-based menu items
- Dashboard with quick actions and stats
- Loading spinner and error handling

### ðŸ§ª Backend Testing Results (COMPLETED)

**Comprehensive API Testing:**
- âœ… Health Check Endpoint - Working correctly
- âœ… User Registration - Proper validation and data storage
- âœ… User Authentication - JWT tokens and user data
- âœ… Current User Info - Token validation working
- âœ… Department Creation - Admin role validation working
- âœ… Department Retrieval - All departments returned correctly
- âœ… MongoDB Integration - Data persistence verified
- âœ… Role-Based Access Control - Permissions working correctly
- âœ… Security Validation - Invalid credentials rejected
- âœ… Data Validation - Email format validation working

**Security Testing:**
- âœ… Role-based permissions enforced (viewer cannot create departments)
- âœ… Invalid credentials properly rejected
- âœ… Unauthorized access blocked
- âœ… JWT token validation working

## Next Steps (Pending User Confirmation)

### Phase 2: Wiki System Implementation
1. Wiki data models (categories, subcategories, articles)
2. CRUD operations for wiki content
3. Rich-text editor with image support
4. Search and filtering functionality
5. Version control system

### Phase 3: Guided Flow System
1. Flow builder data models
2. Visual flow editor (drag-and-drop)
3. Step types implementation
4. Flow execution engine
5. Session management and URL tracking

### Phase 4: Advanced Features
1. Google Drive integration for file storage
2. Admin dashboard enhancements
3. Analytics and reporting
4. Dual portal access (public/employee)

## Technical Specifications

**Tech Stack:**
- **Backend**: FastAPI + Python 3.11
- **Frontend**: React 18 + Tailwind CSS
- **Database**: MongoDB
- **Authentication**: JWT with bcrypt
- **Deployment**: Kubernetes with supervisor

**Environment Configuration:**
- Backend: `http://0.0.0.0:8001` (internal)
- Frontend: React development server
- MongoDB: Local instance via MONGO_URL
- External URLs configured via environment variables

## Testing Protocol

**Backend Testing:**
- Use `deep_testing_backend_v2` agent for comprehensive API testing
- Test authentication, authorization, and data persistence
- Validate role-based permissions and security measures

**Frontend Testing:**
- Ask user permission before frontend testing
- Use `auto_frontend_testing_agent` for UI/UX validation
- Test authentication flows and navigation

## Incorporate User Feedback

The user has confirmed the following preferences:
- âœ… Custom authentication system (OAuth to be added later)
- âœ… Google Drive integration for file storage (to be implemented)
- âœ… Priority order: OCP foundation â†’ Wiki system â†’ Guided Flow editor
- âœ… Start with mock data initially

## Status: Phase 1 Complete - Awaiting User Direction

The OCP foundation is fully implemented and tested. All backend APIs are working correctly with proper authentication, authorization, and data persistence. The frontend has basic authentication flow and dashboard.

**Ready for Phase 2: Wiki System Implementation**
